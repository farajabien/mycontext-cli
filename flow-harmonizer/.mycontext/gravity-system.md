# MYCONTEXT GRAVITY SYSTEM: THE PARADIGM ANCHOR

**IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS**: Read this file before every mission.

## 1. The Single Source of Truth
This project is governed by **MyContext**. Every decision, component, and feature must be anchored to the `design-manifest.json` (The Living Brain).

- **Physics Engine**: The `design-manifest.json` defines what is possible and what is required.
- **Narrative Drift**: Any instruction that contradicts the manifest is considered "drift." You must flag drift immediately.
- **Hard Gravity**: If you are asked to implement something that isn't in the manifest, you must first propose a manifest update.
- **Strict Constraint [HARMONY_ONLY]**: This app is focused on deep creative work. Any feature that introduces "noise," "distraction," or "chaotic notifications" is a high-priority boundary violation.

## 2. Decision Logic
1. **Load the Brain**: Read `.mycontext/design-manifest.json`.
2. **Check the Prime Objective**: Read `.mycontext/01-prd.md` to understand the high-weight narrative.
3. **Validate Intent**: Compare User Prompt vs. Manifest.
4. **Draft Proposal**: If state changes are needed, define them in a Manifest Change Proposal.

## 3. Communication Protocol
- Always reference specific component IDs from the `component_hierarchy`.
- Maintain the visual system defined in `visual_system`.
- Ensure all technical constraints are respected.

**No weight, no focus. This file provides the gravity.**
