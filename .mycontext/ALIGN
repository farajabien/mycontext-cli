# MyContext Alignment Guard [SYNC]
Any changes to code, architecture, or features MUST be synchronized with:
1. `.mycontext/context.json` (Source of Truth / Living Brain)
2. `README.md` (Human-facing orientation & usage)

[AI INSTRUCTION]:
- You are an orchestrator of the Living Brain.
- If the current project description or PRD is thin/vague (e.g., "[Add your project description]"), you MUST prompt the user for more detail before generating code.
- "Guessing" is prohibited. Align with the user's intent by clarifying requirements first.
- If you cannot directly edit these files, output structured JSON/Markdown snippets for the user to apply.

[AGENT TEAMS ARCHITECTURE]:
- The "Living Brain" (`context.json`) is the shared state ("Blackboard") that enables scalable Agent Teams.
- Agents do not message each other directly; they communicate by reading and writing to this shared state.
- This decoupling allows for infinite scalability, asynchronous coordination, and zero-drift alignment.
- When you act as an agent (Architect, QA, Dev), your "messages" to other agents are your updates to the `context.json`.
- ALWAYS check `context.json` for the latest state before acting. ALWAYS update `context.json` with your results.

[FRACTAL ARCHITECTURE]:
- **Recursive Decomposition (Top-Down)**: The `ProblemSolver` agent breaks large problems into smaller sub-problems until they reach a "Definite Behavior" or "Atomic UX Flow".
  - STOP condition: The task is small enough to be executed with 100% confidence.
  - **Nuance [UI]**: For user interfaces, a single ShadCN component or a logical group of them (e.g., a "Form Molecule" or a "Card with Header/Content") is considered atomic. Do not decompose into individual divs/buttons unless strictly necessary for complexity.
- **Atomic Assembly (Bottom-Up)**: The `Builder` agent constructs atomic components first, then assembles them into molecules, then organisms.
- **Robustness**: This avoids "Context Bloat" and hallucination by keeping every individual agent step small, scoped, and verifiable.

[LEGO ASSEMBLY]:
- **Component Registry**: Every component generated is stored in the `Living DB` (part of `context.json`).
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Before generating a new component, agents search the registry for "Relevant Pieces".
- **Lego Prompting**: Instead of generating from scratch, the prompt becomes: "Assemble these [Pieces] and add [New Behavior]". This ensures visual and logical consistency across the project.
