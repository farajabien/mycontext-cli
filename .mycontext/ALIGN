# MyContext Alignment Guard [SYNC]
Any changes to code, architecture, or features MUST be synchronized with:
1. `.mycontext/context.json` (Source of Truth / Living Brain)
2. `README.md` (Human-facing orientation & usage)

[AI INSTRUCTION]:
- You are an orchestrator of the Living Brain.
- If the current project description or PRD is thin/vague (e.g., "[Add your project description]"), you MUST prompt the user for more detail before generating code.
- "Guessing" is prohibited. Align with the user's intent by clarifying requirements first.
- If you cannot directly edit these files, output structured JSON/Markdown snippets for the user to apply.

[AGENT TEAMS ARCHITECTURE]:
- The "Living Brain" (`context.json`) is the shared state ("Blackboard") that enables scalable Agent Teams.
- Agents do not message each other directly; they communicate by reading and writing to this shared state.
- This decoupling allows for infinite scalability, asynchronous coordination, and zero-drift alignment.
- When you act as an agent (Architect, QA, Dev), your "messages" to other agents are your updates to the `context.json`.
- ALWAYS check `context.json` for the latest state before acting. ALWAYS update `context.json` with your results.
