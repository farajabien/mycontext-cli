# 🗺️ MyContext Roadmap: The Path to Autonomous Evolution

## 🌟 Vision
To move from "Static Context Generation" to a "Deterministic Autonomous Engine" where projects evolve themselves while remaining perfectly anchored to design intent.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: The Foundation (Core & CLI) [Completed]
- [x] **Living DB**: Deterministic manifest engine (`.mycontext`).
- [x] **Screenshot → Spec**: High-fidelity UI analysis via Gemini 2.0.
- [x] **CodeGen Engine**: 95%+ accurate shadcn/ui component generation.
- [x] **Hard Gravity Anchors**: Narrative weights that prevent AI drift.

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Multi-Agent Architecture [Completed]
- [x] **Agent Teams (Blackboard Pattern)**: 15 specialized agents (Architect, CodeGen, QA, Security, Backend, etc.) coordinating via shared `context.json` state.
- [x] **Living Brain (`BrainClient`)**: Persistent state machine with versioned updates, artifacts, and narrative tracking.
- [x] **TUI Planning Mode**: AI-driven interview that populates `MegaContext` before any code is generated.
- [x] **Deterministic Scaffolding (`ScaffoldAgent`)**: Full Next.js + InstantDB project generation from `MegaContext`.
- [x] **Multi-Provider AI (`AICore`)**: 5 providers (Claude, GitHub Models, OpenRouter, Gemini, XAI) with automatic fallback chain.

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Fractal Architecture & Component Memory [Completed]
- [x] **Fractal Decomposition**: Recursive top-down problem solving with configurable depth and atomic UI stop conditions.
- [x] **Lego Assembly (Component Registry)**: Living DB stores every generated component. Semantic retrieval injects relevant "pieces" into prompts for pattern reuse.
- [x] **Dependency Sentinel**: Auto-detects and installs missing packages before code generation.
- [x] **Context-Aware PlanningMode**: Reads existing `context.json` and personalizes the interview to refine, not regenerate.

---

## 🔄 Phase 4: The Autonomous Loop [In Progress]
- [/] **Interactive Agent REPL**: Persistent conversational loop for `mycontext agent` (chat → plan → execute → update Brain).
- [ ] **Package Installer Agent**: Autonomous dependency resolution (The Resolver).
- [ ] **Interactive Testing MCP**: Deep integration with Playwright/Jest for local feedback loops.
- [ ] **Narrative Memory**: Circuit breakers for infinite fix-loops.

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Intelligent Refactoring [Upcoming]
- [ ] **Migration Agents**: Automated framework migrations (e.g., Solid to React) anchored in specs.
- [ ] **Design System Sync**: Continuous alignment between `globals.css` and generated components.
- [ ] **Visual Diffing**: Automated screenshot-to-implementation visual assertion.

---

## 🚀 Phase 6: Full Autonomous Development [Future]
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Swarms**: Collaborative agents with specialized roles (Backend, Frontend, DevOps).
- [ ] **Cloud-Anchored Living DB**: Collaborative real-time design-to-code syncing.
- [ ] **Autonomous App Evolution**: AI-driven feature discovery based on user feedback loops.
