# 🗺️ MyContext Roadmap: The Path to Autonomous Evolution

## 🌟 Vision
To move from "Static Context Generation" to a "Deterministic Autonomous Engine" where projects evolve themselves while remaining perfectly anchored to design intent.

---

## 📅 Phase 1: The Foundation (Core & CLI) [Completed]
- [x] **Living DB**: Deterministic manifest engine (`.mycontext`).
- [x] **Screenshot → Spec**: High-fidelity UI analysis via Gemini 2.0.
- [x] **CodeGen Engine**: 95%+ accurate shadcn/ui component generation.
- [x] **Hard Gravity Anchors**: Narrative weights that prevent AI drift.

---

## 🔄 Phase 2: The Autonomous Loop [In Progress]
- [/] **Continuous Coding Loop**: Architecting the Task Generator -> Executor -> QA flow.
- [ ] **Package Installer Agent**: Autonomous dependency resolution (The Resolver).
- [ ] **Interactive Testing MCP**: Deep integration with Playwright/Jest for local feedback loops.
- [ ] **Narrative Memory**: Circuit breakers for infinite fix-loops.

---

## 🧪 Phase 3: Intelligent Refactoring [Upcoming]
- [ ] **Migration Agents**: Automated framework migrations (e.g., Solid to React) anchored in specs.
- [ ] **Design System Sync**: Continuous alignment between `globals.css` and generated components.
- [ ] **Visual Diffing**: Automated screenshot-to-implementation visual assertion.

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Full Autonomous Development [Future]
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Swarms**: Collaborative agents with specialized roles (Backend, Frontend, DevOps).
- [ ] **Cloud-Anchored Living DB**: Collaborative real-time design-to-code syncing.
- [ ] **Autonomous App Evolution**: AI-driven feature discovery based on user feedback loops.
