# MyContext Business Model

## Open Source + Hosted API

MyContext follows a similar model to Supabase, Stripe, and other developer-first companies:

### Free & Open Source

- **MyContext CLI**: Context pack + prompt generator (MIT License)
- **Context Templates**: `.mycontext/` file structure and best-practice templates
- **Prompt Formats**: Stitch-optimized + general prompt output
- **Documentation**: Full guides and API references
- **Community Support**: GitHub issues, Discord

### Paid Services (Coming Soon)

#### MyContext AI API

Hosted API for **context enrichment + prompt optimization** for AI design tools.

**Pricing** (TBD):

- Pay-per-project or pay-per-context-pack
- Monthly subscription tiers
- Enterprise custom pricing

**Benefits**:

- Higher-quality design outputs from AI designers (less prompt iteration)
- Better consistency (brand, flows, states)
- Faster time-to-first-design
- Optional team sharing / sync of context packs (future)

#### Future Services

- **MyContext PM**: AI-powered project management (web app)
- **Enterprise Support**: SLA, dedicated support, custom training
- **Custom Fine-tuning**: Train on your design system

## Why This Model?

**For Users**:

- Try for free with your own AI keys
- Upgrade when you need production quality
- No vendor lock-in - CLI always free

**For MyContext**:

- Sustainable development funding
- Invest in model training and improvement
- Provide enterprise-grade infrastructure
- Build community around open source

## Competitive Advantages

**vs Closed Source Tools** (Lovable, v0.dev, Bolt):

- You own the code and infrastructure
- No data sent to third parties
- Transparent about how it works
- Can self-host everything

**vs Generic AI** (ChatGPT, Claude):

- Specialized for **design prompts** and **context completeness**
- Structured `.mycontext/` pack instead of ad-hoc long prompts
- Gap detection so you don’t ship incomplete requirements to the AI designer

**vs Other Open Source**:

- Production-ready code generation
- 12+ validation checkpoints
- Hosted API option for convenience
- Continuous model improvement

## Fair Use Policy

**Open Source CLI**:

- Use commercially without restrictions
- Modify and redistribute (MIT License)
- No attribution required (appreciated!)

**MyContext AI API**:

- Fair usage limits on free tier (TBD)
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention
- Enterprise plans for high volume

## Revenue Sharing (Future)

We're exploring:

- Revenue sharing for community contributions
- Bounties for Intent Dictionary patterns
- Affiliate program for referrals
- Open source sponsorship matching
