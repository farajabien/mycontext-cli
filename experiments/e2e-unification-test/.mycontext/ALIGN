# MyContext Alignment Guard [SYNC]
Any changes to code, architecture, or features MUST be synchronized with:
1. `.mycontext/context.json` (Source of Truth / Living Brain)
2. `README.md` (Human-facing orientation & usage)

[INSTRUCTION]: If you are an AI assistant and cannot directly edit these files, you MUST output structured JSON/Markdown snippets for the user to apply, ensuring the project's documentation never drifts from reality.
