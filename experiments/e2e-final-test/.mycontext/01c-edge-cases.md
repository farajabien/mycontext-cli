# Edge Cases


### [Input Handling] Player presses both arrow keys simultaneously.
**Mitigation:** Prioritize the last key pressed or lock simultaneous key presses.

---
### [Physics] Ball gets stuck bouncing between two bricks without progressing.
**Mitigation:** Implement a random deviation in the ball's trajectory after a certain number of consecutive bounces.

---
### [Level Progression] Player finishes the last level but no victory message is shown.
**Mitigation:** Ensure a defined 'end of game' state with a victory message and replay option.
