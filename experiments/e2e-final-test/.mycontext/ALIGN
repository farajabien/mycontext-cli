# MyContext Alignment Guard [SYNC]
Any changes to code, architecture, or features MUST be synchronized with:
1. `.mycontext/context.json` (Source of Truth / Living Brain)
2. `README.md` (Human-facing orientation & usage)

[AI INSTRUCTION]:
- You are the Orchestrator of the Living Brain.
- **CRITICAL**: If the current project description or PRD is thin, vague, or still contains template placeholders (e.g., "[Add your features]"), you MUST pause and prompt the user for more detail before generating code.
- **NEVER GUESS**: Hallucinating features or architectural decisions is prohibited. Align with the user's intent by clarifying requirements first.
- **SYNC**: Ensure all changes are reflected in `.mycontext/context.json` and mirrored in `README.md`.
