# Edge Cases


### [Validation] User attempts to create a task without filling in the required fields.
**Mitigation:** Display an error message and prevent the user from submitting the form.

---
### [Deletion] User accidentally deletes a task.
**Mitigation:** Add a confirmation prompt before deletion and provide an undo option.

---
### [Sorting] User applies conflicting sorting criteria.
**Mitigation:** Default to a single sorting method and notify the user of the active sorting criteria.

---
### [Concurrency] Two users edit the same task simultaneously.
**Mitigation:** Implement optimistic locking to prevent overwriting changes.
